<h1>Welcome to Wasteless Bites!<h1>

Every day restaurants have an excess amount of food at the end of each day and throw away all the leftovers. Wasteless Bites can help prevent unnecessary waste and help those that might be in need for free. Restaurants can use the website to post/share food for people instead of throwing it away at the end of day. It is also a great way to raise awareness about their surplus food items and attract potential customers.
